# NAME

Git::CPAN::Patch - Patch CPAN modules using Git

# VERSION

version 2.5.0

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
# import a module:

% git-cpan clone Foo::Bar
% cd Foo-Bar

# hack and submit to RT

# it's probably best to work in a branch
% git checkout -b blah

... hack lib/Foo/Bar.pm ...

% git commit -am "blah"
% git-cpan send-patch

# update the module
# this automatically rebases the current branch
% git-cpan update
```

# DESCRIPTION

[Git::CPAN::Patch](https://metacpan.org/pod/Git%3A%3ACPAN%3A%3APatch) provides a suite of git commands
aimed at making trivially
easy the process of  grabbing
any distribution off CPAN, stuffing it
in a local git repository and, once gleeful
hacking has been perpetrated, sending back
patches to its maintainer.

NOTE: This module is supported in Linux, BSD, and the like. This 
module is **not** supported in Microsoft Windows (Cygwin, Strawberry Perl). 
See [CPAN Testers Matrix](http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=Git-CPAN-Patch)
for currently supported operating systems.
